About Twitter Wall
TwitterWall is a simple, yet powerful PHP application powered by jQuery.


What is Twitter Wall?
Twitter Wall is a real-time twitter search application, so, when someone updates a status that contains terms
you're interested in, it will update the wall in real time. 

What can I do with it?
The things Twitter Wall can do are endless, I just tried to give you some examples:

	   Expose what people are saying about you or your business directly on your site
	   Promoting events
	   Conferences
	   Fallow trending topics
	   Promoting Competitions
	   ... and more, just unleash your imagination



Features

Twitter like search terms (#hashtag or simple string and more)
Fully AJAXed
Easily Styling - you can create your own theme in minutes or use existing ones
One code line installation
No mySQL
Scalable
Fully OOP

TwitterWall comes with 3 themes I made and also there are the PSD files where needed.

System Requirements

	PHP 4 or 5
	cURL (already enabled on most systems) (if you don't have it installed fallow http://bit.ly/6WPzlb)this installation guide
	jQuery 1.3.2

Instalation

	Unzip the package you downloaded from Envato
	From Deploy get the folder inside and place it in your porject folder.
	
		Now just refference the jQuery and TwitterWall plugin in your header. Like:
		<script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
&lt;script src=&quot;path/to/twitterwall/jquery.twitterwall.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

Remember to keep the order, first jQuery library then the plugin, else, won't work
	
	In your template, choose an area where do you want to place the TwitterWall, to do so, place a div like:
		
			<div id='twitterwall'>
					here will appear the twits
			</div>
		
		Also, give a easy to remember and to understand id or class to the div, we will use it later on.

		
		Initiate the plugin by adding the fallowing script into your header.
		
					<script type="text/javascript"><br/>
			$(document).ready(function(){<br/>
				<strong>$('#twitterWall').twitterWall({hashtag: '#Graffiti', interval: 5000});
			});
		</script>

		We are selecting the div we defined earlier, 'start' our plugin and tell that we want to search for #Twitter, at an interval of 5 seconds (5000 in miliseconds)
	Done, the twits should appear where they should :)

Advanced mode
	If you want to use a style that came with the package, you just have to refference the style into your header. Please fallow.
	The styles are in the themes folder.
	Choose one theme, copy the entire folder (ex:twall-blue) where ever you want 
	Now, just refference the twall-blue.css file in your header.
	
If you are using one of the themes, remember to rename the target div twitterwall else the theme wont work
I've also included a theme skeleton, check Themes folder
